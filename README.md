## 🔁 Automating This README  
To keep this README fresh and updated:  
1. Write a script (e.g., in Python/JavaScript) that fetches your recent submissions via LeetCode’s API or web scraping.  
2. Have the script regenerate the “Recent Solved Problems” table automatically.  
3. Use a GitHub Action workflow that runs daily/weekly, commits the updated `README.md`, and pushes to your profile repo.
